The other modality that already existed before was delivery through companies such as Ritual, Doordash, Skip the Dishes, among others, but the cost is high.\n\nThus, some entrepreneurs thought of themselves starting the process of delivering products to their customers, within a restricted distance area.\n\nThis is an excellent opportunity to create a model that can be suitable for any restaurant that wants this analysis, helping small business owners to adapt their businesses, get to know the competition better and make a better investment decision in this service (or not).\n\n\n### Business Problem\nKnow better your Neighborhood and competition for delivery services: How many restaurants are there in the area to offer the analysis? What types of restaurants are in this region? What is the income of people in the same region to determine the prices to be charged? Where is the best area to provide the delivery services wit best return of investment? The budget is limite and all investments must be very well oriented. \n\n\n### Objective\nCreate a model to obtain the requested data and seek the best way to serve customers through the restaurants that are 5km away of Toronto to be used as a benchmark.\n\nOne key outcome of this model is determine the most strategic region(s) in Toronto for restaurant(s) can strategically expand its services, as the budget is limited due to the limitations imposed during the pandemic.\n\nThe model will be able to serve several restaurant owners who have the need to provide delivery services. This business analisys model can be applied to any restaurants, we just will need include the locations to provide this analitical report to the customer and helo him to understand the senario and data relevance for the investments. \n\n\n### The process to reach the goals \nJoin libraries and databases data into a data frame.\nFor the number of restaurants, types, etc., I used the Foursquare into 5 Km distance of a specific point (this point can be changed as need per the restaurant interested in this analysis). \n\nAll strategic data as locations, neighborhoods, incomes (net) will be analyzed via k-means clustering.\n\n##### Sources/Databases\n- Foursquare to find restaurants \n- Wellbeing Toronto for Demographic/ socioeconomic\n- Wikipedia to find the locations"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.10", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
